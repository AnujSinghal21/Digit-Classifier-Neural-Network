# Digit Classifier Neural Network
This model is an implementation of a machine learning algorithm for classifying handwritten digits using TensorFlow and Python. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset and can be used to predict the digit (0-9) of a 30x30px image of a handwritten digit.
The model has achieved an accuracy of around 99% on the test data set.
